# Neighborhood Map Project Using Angular

## Running the Application

1. Open *index.html* in web browser to run the application.

## Features

* The left list contains the names of each of the markers on the map to the right.

* Clicking on a name in the list will cause the corresponding marker to open a window with information about the location.
  * The Foursquare icon at the end of each information window will take you to the full Foursquare page for that location.

* Clicking on any of the markers will also bring up the window.

* The search bar in the top left of the site allows you to narrow down the locations based on what is typed in. Uppercase and lowercase letters do not matter.
  * To see all the markers again, you can clear the text in the search bar or refresh the page.
